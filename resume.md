    **NeoGDB**
    Based on GDB and OpenOCD 

    **SmartCard Reader**
    I wrote specifications of the proprietary usb protocol the company would use then search for appropriate electronical components, read datasheets then Hardware design the smartcard reader.
    Based on AVR32 chip, I wrote code so as to make the bootloader, the USB communication and firmware update.

**Multi-voltage JTAG/Serial dongle**
:    Hardware design of a JTAG/Serial dongle able to works on different voltage (1,8v - 3,3v - 5v) or can use any voltage between 1,8v to 5,0v. Based on [FT4232H](http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/ICs/FT4232H.htm) chip you can, at the same time, control your CPU using JTAG and received debug information via Serial port.

**Brutas**
:    I wrote tool to automate my research in security flaws on embedded products. Thanks to it I was able to find various breaches in surveillance cameras.
